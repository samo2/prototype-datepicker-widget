This datepicker widget uses Prototype and Scriptaculous.  It was originally created by Mathieu Jondet (mathieu@eulerian.com) of Eulerian Technologies and includes code by Arturas Slajus for extending the formatting.  Mathieu has moved on, but I want to keep developing this.  Let me know if you would like to as well.  Contact me at tigre@pobox.com

v1.0 now includes customizable and combinable [date filters](DatePickerFilter.md) to limit what dates can be selected.  There's even an example of using a Google calendar as the data source for a filter.
